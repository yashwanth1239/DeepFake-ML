# Deepfake Detection System (Samsung PRISM)

## üìå Overview
This project was developed under the **Samsung PRISM program** at **Samsung R&D Institute**.  
It focuses on **real-time deepfake detection** using advanced CNN architectures, optimized for scalability and deployment on **resource-constrained devices**.

The goal was to **balance accuracy, model size, and inference speed** to make the system practical for real-world use cases, especially on devices with limited computational resources.
